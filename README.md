## Overall Description
The Dim Sum Automaton is a self-rotating table designed to simplify food distribution in a Chinese restaurant setting. It eliminates the need to manually rotate the table, avoiding awkward interactions when trying to turn it to your side. The table operates using sensors placed along its bottom edge, which detect hand gestures. When a hand gesture is detected, the motor that rotates the table stops. Once the gesture is no longer detected, the table resumes its rotation.

The first idea we explored was creating a drink-making challenge, initially focusing on protein shakes but later considering other options like alcoholic beverages or sodas. The concept involves the user selecting an ingredient and shaking the phone to mix it. This process is repeated a specific number of times based on a predefined combination of ingredients and shake intensity set by the owner. If the user makes a mistake or wants to start over, they can tilt the phone 180 degrees to "pour out" the drink, resetting the entire process.
