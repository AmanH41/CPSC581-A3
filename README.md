# Dim Sum Automata

### [Arduino code](https://github.com/AmanH41/CPSC581-A3/blob/ad48f7fe931ab418af80a7792366b0aff2f22288/581A3.ino)  [Python code](https://github.com/AmanH41/CPSC581-A3/blob/ad48f7fe931ab418af80a7792366b0aff2f22288/581A3.py) 

## Overall Description
The Dim Sum Automaton is a self-rotating table designed to simplify food distribution in a Chinese restaurant setting. It eliminates the need to manually rotate the table, avoiding awkward interactions when trying to turn it to your side. The table operates using sensors placed along its bottom edge, which detect hand gestures. When a hand gesture is detected, the motor that rotates the table stops. Once the gesture is no longer detected, the table resumes its rotation.

Among the 10 ideas, the mail alert, door locker, and cable wrapper were my favorites. The mail alert, as the name suggests, is a device that notifies you when you receive mail in your mailbox. As someone who orders things online all the time, the anticipation of receiving my orders often makes me take multiple trips to the mailbox. This device was meant to remedy that issue by alerting me, so I no longer have to check my mailbox frequently. The door locker idea was designed to address a problem I have with my car.Since it's an older model, the door doesn't lock or unlock via the key fob unless I do it manually. The door locker would be a device that physically locks or unlocks the door of my car. Lastly, the cable wrapper idea is exactly as it sounds—a device that would automatically wrap your cables neatly for you.

## Reflection

<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>
The Dim Sum Automata idea was chosen from our group’s ideas due to its niche and uniqueness compared to the others. The idea met the criteria of the assignment and was something the entire group resonated with, as the problem was relatable. We all had similar ideas about how the lazy Susan would operate, but the construction and organization of the Arduino board, wiring, and sensors, as well as the design of the lazy Susan, each had unique approaches. After sharing and exploring each other's ideas for the construction of the Dim Sum Automata, we merged the best parts of everyone’s concepts to create the final blueprint for the project.

The group worked well together and divided the tasks equally. I had more experience with Arduino and was happy to handle the wiring and coding for the system, while Ishrat and Emily focused on constructing and designing the lazy Susan. This allowed us to complete the assignment efficiently. The blueprint for the lazy Susan was set up effectively, as all I had to do was wire and code the sensors and motor according to how we wanted the lazy Susan to function. Ishrat and Emily were then able to construct the body to fit seamlessly with the hardware. This division of work streamlined the building and testing process, enabling us to complete the project with minimal issues.
